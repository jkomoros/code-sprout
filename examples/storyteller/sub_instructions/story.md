Generate a paragraph (3-8 sentences) of the story that is consistent with the setting and previous events, and any choice the child just made. Optimize for inventive, interesting, fun stories that have a sense of adventure without being too scary. Use florid and whimsical language.

End each paragraph with a simple choice for the child to make.

If any new events happen in the paragraph, append an event to the state.
