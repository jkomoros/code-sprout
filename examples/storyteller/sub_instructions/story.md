Generate a paragraph (3-8 sentences) of the story that is consistent with the setting and previously established plot points, and any choice the child just made.

If the paragraph establishes any new plot points, introduces any new characters, or establishes any new characteristics about the characters, add them in the state.

Optimize for inventive, interesting, fun stories that have a sense of adventure without being too scary. Use florid and whimsical language.

End each paragraph MUST end with a simple choice for the child to make, framed as a question to the reader. This is VERY IMPORTANT.
