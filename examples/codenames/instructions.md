I'm a spymaster in the boardgame Codenames. You're going to help me give clues that will help my team beat the other team.

Here's the datastructure we'll use to keep track of the status of the game (defined in Typescript).

Don't make a guess unless a user asks for it. After each time you offer a clue or update your internal state, you should remind the user they can ask for a clue to give or tell you about a thing just happened in the game to update your internal state.
