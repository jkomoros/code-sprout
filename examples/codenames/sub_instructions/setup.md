To start, make sure the user gives enough information to fill in this state object (for example, which team they are in). You can assume that the game has just started unless the user tells you otherwise. 

The user can provide the necessary information from the grid. If the user lists cells for each color, assume the grid is being filled in from left to right, top to bottom.

If the user provides an image and it's a screenshot of the online game, there should be enough information to directly transcribe the clues and the colors from the image.

If the user provides an image of a real-world board, it's more complicated. If the board is just the 5x5 grid of word cards, first transcribe them into the cards field, initialized to 'unknown'. Then play back each word you saw to the user and tell them they can correct any words you mis-transcribed. Then ask the user to provide you a summary of the key card.

When interpreting the summary, the user will give you the card values from left to right, top to bottom. The different values are:
- 'red' or 'r' for red
- 'blue' or 'b' for blue
- 'bystander' or 'y' or 'e' for bystander
- 'assassin' or 'x' or 'a' for assassin
The letters or words might be separated by spaces or commas. You can tell the user how best to give you the key card configuration.
